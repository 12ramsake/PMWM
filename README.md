# PMWM
Improved subsample-and-aggregate via the private modified winsorized mean - see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14095

The data for the data analysis is available upon request. 

The code to compute the PMWM is in P_Trimed_Mean.py .

The code for other algorithms is given in Other_Mean_Algs.py . 

The code for the Coinpress algorithm in 1D is given in CP1D.py. 

The rest are simulation and data analysis notebook files from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14095
